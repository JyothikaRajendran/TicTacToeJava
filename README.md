# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Java Console Game

A simple and interactive two-player **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The game runs on the console and allows players to enter moves, validate positions, and determine the winner or a draw.

---

## 📌 Features
- ✔ 3×3 game board using a 2D character array  
- ✔ Input validation for row and column  
- ✔ Prevents overwriting filled cells  
- ✔ Win detection across rows, columns & diagonals  
- ✔ Draw detection when the board becomes full  
- ✔ Turn switching between **Player X** and **Player O**  
- ✔ Clean code structure using classes and methods

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Classes  
  - Objects  
  - Methods  
  - Encapsulation  
- **2D Arrays** for game board  
- **Loops & Conditionals** for game flow  
- **Scanner Input Handling**  
- **Modular Code Design**
